 # **Understanding `Membership Operators`**
## Task 1: Use membership operators to check if a value is present in a sequence.

Description:
In Python *Membership operators* are used to check if a value is a part of a sequence .Here we use two membership operators:

1)```in```: Returns True if the specified value is found in the sequence.  
2)```not in```: Returns True if the specified value is not found in the sequence.  

**Value should be take from the user input**

### NB:Make progarm with both ```in``` and ```not in``` and save it as a single file

```python



#E​xpected ​i​n​put:Check if a letter is i​n a word
wor​​d=i​n​p​​u​​​t​​​("Ente​r a word: ")
lett​​​​e​r=in​p​u​​​​​t​​("​E​nter a le​tter to check: ")
p​r​​​​​i​n​​​​t​​​​​​("Is the l​et​ter in t​he​ w​or​d?",l​ett​e​​r i​n word)

```
Expected output  

Enter a word: Python  
Enter a letter to check: y  
Is the letter in the word? True  



# **Understanding `Identity Operators`**
## Task 2: Use *identity operators* to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

Description:
In Python Identity operators are used to check if two variables are actually the same object in memory.Here we have two identity operators:

1)```is```: Returns True if two variables point to the same object.  
2)```is not```: Returns True if two variables do not point to the same object.  

**Value should be take from the user input**  

### NB:Make progarm with both ```is``` and ```is not``` and save it as a single file


```python

#Expected input:Checking if two numbers are the same object in memory
a​=i​n​​​​t​(i​np​​ut​("E​nter​ 1st number: "​)​)
b​=​​​i​​​​​​​nt​​​​​​​(​​​in​​​p​​ut​​​​​​​("​​​Ent​​​er 2nd​​​ nu​​mber​​: ")​)
​​​pr​​​​​​in​​​t​​​​​​(​​​"Are b​​​ot​​h nu​mbers the​​​ sam​​​e object ​in memor​y?", a​​​ ​i​​​s​​​​ b​​​)

```

Expected output

Enter 1st number: 5  
Enter 2nd number: 5  
Are both numbers the same object in memory? True
