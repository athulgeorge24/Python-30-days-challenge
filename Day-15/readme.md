# Functions in Python

Functions are a crucial part of Python programming. They allow us to organize our code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks. Here's a quick overview:

## Defining and Using Functions
☛ Definition: Functions are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`  
☛ Parameters: Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return results using the return statement  
☛ Calling: A function is invoked by writing its name followed by parentheses  

Example:
```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    return

# Calling the function
print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Function Implementation

✦Write a function named `multiply_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product  
✦Write another function named `is_even` that checks if a number is even  
✦Return True if the number is even, otherwise return False  


### Task 2: Function with Default Arguments

✦Create a function called `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a rectangle  
✦If only one argument is provided, treat it as a square (use a default value for the second argument)  
✦Test the function with one argument and two arguments
