# Special Tasks

## Task 1:Fibonacci series
Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and n  

ðŸ‘‰The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :  
  - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
    
ðŸ‘‰Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it  

`tip: you can use loop statements to do this program`  
Expected output
```python
Enter the limi: 100  
Fibonacci series upto 100 : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
```

## Task 2:Multiplcation table  

Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number 

`tip: you can use loop statements to do this program`  
Expected Output:
```python
Input a number: 6                                                       
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60

```
