# Loops in Python

## Discription
Loops are constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports 2 main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. 

## 1) The `for` loop 

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

```python
#Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to execute
```

### Task :Print a Simple `*` Pattern
Create a program to print a simple star pattern based on the number of rows provided by user.

⛤The program should take the number of rows as input.
⛤For each row, print a line with the corresponding number of stars (*).
⛤The number of stars in each row should increase by one as you go down the rows.

(You can use `range` function to proceed the program)

Expected output:
```python
Enter the number of rows: 7
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******

```
