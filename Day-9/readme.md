# Loops in Python (Continuation..)

## 2)The `while` loop

A while loop in Python is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True. 
It is commonly used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, but instead depends on some runtime condition.
```python
#Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code to execute repeatedly
```
## Task: Find the First Odd Number in a Series

Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers one by one and stops as soon as the user enters an odd number. 

*Instructions*
The while loop is useful for processing input repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this task, you will:
Ⅰ. Use a while loop to continuously ask the user for a number.
Ⅱ. Check if the number is odd.
Ⅲ. Stop the loop and display a message when an odd number is entered.


### Expected output:
```python
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 8
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 7
You entered an odd number: 7
```
